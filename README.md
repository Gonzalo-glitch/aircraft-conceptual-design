# Aircraft Conceptual Design (Fixed-Wing) — MATLAB + Excel + CATIA

## Overview
Conceptual design workflow for a fixed-wing commercial aircraft configuration.
This repository is used as a portfolio-style record of the project, including:
- Preliminary calculations implemented in **MATLAB**
- Result tracking / trend fitting in **Excel**
- 3D configuration model developed in **CATIA** (images)

> Status: **Under construction** — folder structure and documentation are set up first. Files are added progressively.

## Repository structure
- `docs/` — project documentation and figures
  - `docs/images/catia/` — CATIA model screenshots
- `src/` — source code
  - `src/matlab/isa_atmosphere/` — ISA atmosphere utilities
  - `src/matlab/sizing/` — conceptual sizing and calculations
- `tools/excel/` — Excel sheets used for result tracking / trend fitting
- `results/` — exported plots/tables (optional)
- `data/` — input datasets or example inputs (optional)

## What will be added
- CATIA model screenshots (key views)
- MATLAB scripts:
  - ISA atmosphere calculator
  - main sizing / calculation script
- Excel workbook with results (aligned with MATLAB outputs)

## Notes
Public portfolio repository: academic/personal content only (no proprietary course material).
